        We save you money in the long run by avoiding insurance increases. In
        Georgia, the insurance companies assess points and your insurance rate
        using their own system that takes into account your driving history. We
        can have your ticket reduced to a charge that will not report on your
        driving history and avoid the insurance company increasing your rates.

      text: Driving is a privilege, but in reality driving is a necessity in modern
        society - especially if you are a CDL or carshare driver. Having a bad
        driving history or losing your ability to drive may cost you a job.
        Don't try to "wing it" in court with your driver's license at stake.

      text: Save the hassle from attending court. In that vast majority of our cases,
        we can attend court on your behalf without you taking time out of your

      text: We handle FTA cases. If you have missed court or forgotten about your old
        citations that are finally catching up to you, we can help clear your
        Failure to Appear cases. Sometimes simply paying a fine to clear your
        old cases is not possible or not advisable. We can negotiate with the
        court on your behalf to resolve your Failure to Appear cases in the best
        manner possible.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
